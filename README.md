# Tic Tac Toe using CPP
This is the code of the tic tac toe game with the simplest logic for beginners who try to learn CPP.
# Code Description
For ease, I put the whole code in a single .cpp file, so the sequence of code is as follow:

2. then there is main function which runs the whole game
3. and after the main function, there are the definitions of functions

Any tips on how it can be better or suggestions are appreciated.
